    % likelihood function for given parameters and performance
    % simplest RW, only two free parameters, no independent LRs

    %parameters: vector (1xn parameters), transformed to logit/log space
    %subj: struct, from output of a simulated agent
    %subj.choices: n_trials x 1, for decisions 
    %subj.feedback.outcomes: n_trials x number of options, all feedback received (including
    those not entering total score)

    output negative LL for future fmin
