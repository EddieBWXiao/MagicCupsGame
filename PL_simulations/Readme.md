# PL_simulations

Repository for simulations and model fitting scripts for simple probabilistic learning tasks

To explore the pipeline and the role of each function, see:

**single_ptp_demo.m**: a demo for 1) running a single simulation and 2) perform model fitting for the virtual participant generated



To add:

Script for exploring parameter-WSLS relations

Demo for explaining different model fitting procedures available
