Parse_MagicCups: convert .csv output from Gorilla to information about choice & task structure (for one participant)

**Quality control measures**

**Simulate participant behaviour**

sim_average_RW2lr_IBLT: for a given combination of parameter values, produce average performance on Magic Cups Game.

**Model-independent measures (calc_)**

**Exploring Simulations (sim_)**



**Other functions:**

gen_: a series of functions able to produce struct variable containing a task design, with contingencies specified in input, and trial-wise outcomes generated randomly with each implementation.

**Folders:**

PL_simulations: for code simulating tasks with only one outcome type (simple reinforcement learning tasks, for building simple Rescorla-Wagner models)
